Each supported\r\napplication is also called a _module_, and each folder it describes is \r\ncalled a _submodule_.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n### Backups\r\n\r\nThere are two options to make backups before cleaning a directory.\r\n\r\n* **Automatic**\r\n\t\tIf the directory to clean is below the size limit, a backup will be automatically\r\n\t\texecuted before the clean begins.\r\n\t\r\n* **Manual**\r\n\t\tThe alternative, just click the `Backup` button when selecting a submodule.\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n### Reports\r\n\r\nThis feature is useful if you want to keep track of the freed space, the amount of files deleted,\r\nor any other data you are interested in. They are stored as JSON files and are easy viewable if you\r\ngo to `View --> Reports`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [Installation instructions](https://github.com/sebikul/mundus/wiki/Installation) and follow the steps for your current Linux distribution.\r\n\r\n## Software Requirements\r\n\r\nMundus requires the [Gambas3](http://gambas.sf.net>) runtime, and the following components:\r\n\r\n* gb.image\r\n* gb.qt4\r\n* gb.form\r\n* gb.desktop\r\n* gb.desktop.x11\r\n* gb.settings\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
